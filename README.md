# Web Flex & YACC IDE

A lightweight web-based development environment for Flex and YACC/Bison, featuring isolated sessions and easy file transfer capabilities. This containerized solution allows multiple users to work with Flex and YACC/Bison through their web browsers without requiring any local installation.

## Features

- üåê Browser-based access to Flex and YACC/Bison tools.
- üîí Isolated sessions per browser tab.
- üìÅ Easy file upload/download through browser.
- üßπ Automatic cleanup of session files.
- üöÄ No client-side installation required.
- üîß Includes GCC for compilation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mgk1991/web-flex-yacc

# Enter the directory
cd web-flex-yacc

# Start the container
docker compose up -d
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:7681`

## Usage

Each browser tab creates an temporal isolated session with its own workspace. All files are automatically deleted when closing the tab.

### File Transfer
- To upload files to the terminal workspace: Type `rz` in the terminal and select your file through the browser window.
- To download files from workspace to your computer: Type `sz filename` in the terminal and check your downloads folder.

### Development Flow
1. Open a new browser tab for a fresh session.
2. Upload your Flex (.l) and Bison (.y) files using `rz` or create/edit them locally using nano.
3. Compile and test your code.
4. Download results using `sz filename`.
5. Close the tab when done - all files will be automatically cleaned up from the server.
